<br />
<br />Also you may fail to get blank space BEFORE text from &quot;ECHO.  text&quot;
<br />
<br />Instead of an empty line, or &quot;   text&quot;, it may instead announce
<br />'echo.' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
<br />operable program or batch file.
<br />
<br />The above error happens if the CMD.EXE can find an extension-less file with the name echo, in which case instead of &quot;echoing&quot; text it tries to execute that file, even if that file has zero length.
<br />
<br />Various alternatives seem to work more reliably, including
<br />ECHO\
<br />ECHO:
<br />ECHO/
<br />
<br />Because I wasted a few hours of my life debugging a very complex batch script to identify this problem, I prefer to avoid any future confusion of : and \ as elements of a file path, and am now using
<br />ECHO/

				<div class="content">I agree that a file called &quot;echo&quot; MAY cause problems,
<br />but feel it is inappropriate for DosTips to needlessly punish an innocent user of a batch script that happens to visit a multiplicity of folders to purge junk that was left behind when a security program was removed.
<br />
<br />After installing Comodo Firewall I ran a user forum supplied script to remove many remnants that were typically left behind, BUT due to permissions issues I spotted the odd &quot;Access is denied&quot; and &quot;cannot access&quot; within the screens of output messages as CD and DEL and REG.EXE commands flooded my monitor, but no clue upon which command / target was responsible.  The script aimed CD at a directory that was often not present, but ignored the error and proceeded to delete any files with &quot;target&quot; names that happened to be in its previous CD location.  It also ignored &quot;Access is denied&quot; and &quot;cannot access&quot; messages.  I inserted ECHO ON in various places to track down the command / targets giving problems, and then I took ownership and resolved the permissions problems.  The original script ignored all errors, and a few VITAL &quot;access&quot; errors were totally obscured by the flood of so many perfectly VALID &quot;error&quot; messages, e.g. :-
<br />The system cannot find the path specified.
<br />Could Not Find ...
<br />Error:  The system was unable to find the specified registry key or value.
<br />
<br />I ran that user script 12 times in 25 minutes whilst identifying and fixing permission issues.  When I finally succeeded with a sigh of relief I rebooted and then checked the event log for errors.
<br />
<br />There was some problem with recovery on 4 off .NET framework files upon the first reboot, but further reboots appeared error free.
<br />I subsequently found that ...\System32\wbem\AutoRecover had increased from the 10 off *.MOF files accumulated during the 5 year life of the P.C. to 54 files.  I am concerned that in 25 minutes that script with no error checking has now added another 22 years worth of degradation to my P.C. - and .NET Framework was bad enough before all this ! ! !
<br />
<br />I now believe that the original script corrupted Catroot which has now been rebuilt, BUT AutoRecovery still holds 54 *.MOF files and I have asked on 6 forums but no-one has given definitive guidance upon whether the corruption has been cured or masked.
<br />
<br />I have decided to restore the drive C:\ image I captured BEFORE I removed Comodo, and avoid all errors as I make a second attempt.
<br />
<br />For my second attempt I have revised the original script with all output and error messages redirected to error checking that suppresses all &quot;not present&quot; types of indications, and only displays the &quot;permission failure&quot; types of errors.
<br />
<br />I was disappointed that my final test run of my script included the spurious
<br />&quot;'echo.' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
<br />operable program or batch file.&quot;
<br />
<br />This error was only when deleting files from one specific directory that happened to have a file named &quot;ECHO&quot;.  This error was produced by only one of a large number of &quot;ECHO.&quot; command with which I was documenting the progress of the script.  This error only happened upon the first run of the script within a DOS shell - subsequent runs had no such error.  I only saw an error because of my extreme care.
<br />It took me a few hours to identify and cure the problem.
<br />
<br />To avoid any future problems I will never again use &quot;ECHO.&quot; for a blank line.
<br />I suggest it would be a kindness to forum members if the unreliable &quot;ECHO.&quot; be replaced with anything else (such as ECHO/) to avoid punishing them for the presence of a naughty ECHO file that they never knew about.
<br />
<br />Technically, ECHO. is a serious waste of CPU cycles.
<br />
<br />My experience demonstrates that when file ECHO exists in the current directory the script will try to execute that file.  This implies that if the file ECHO exists ANYWHERE on the %PATH% it will be executed.
<br />WORSE, even if there is no such file, when the script encounters &quot;ECHO.&quot; it will not immediately print the blank line, but will first trawl through every directory that is on the %PATH% to see if there is an ECHO to execute.
<br />
<br />For the last 30 years I have designed Real Time security systems with 8 bit processors.  My focus has been to ensure continuous unstoppable error free operation, and efficiency of code in a limited address space.  I ensured the code was correct, and that it had dependable fail-safe mechanisms for dealing with the unexpected.
<br />
<br />Windows has been a bitter pill to swallow now that I am retired.
<br />
<br />The presence of a file named &quot;ECHO&quot; was unexpected, but should now be no surprise, and I feel that once an unexpected error mechanism has been identified it should be avoided.
<br />

				<div class="content">alan_b,
<br />
<br />Your finding is quite interesting.  I reproduced the issue on a XP box.  The problem only seems to happen when a file named &quot;echo&quot; exist in the current directory.  I could not see the problem if the file exist in a different directory referenced by the path variable.
<br />To try this out I create a file named &quot;echo&quot; in the c:\windows\system32 folder, which is referenced in the path variable, and then run &quot;echo. ecko#&quot; inside and outside this folder from a command line.  Here is a dump:
<br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>C:\&gt;echo. ekko1&amp;pushd c:\windows\system32&amp;echo. ekko2&amp;popd<br />&nbsp;ekko1<br />&nbsp;ekko2<br /><br />C:\&gt;type NUL&gt;c:\windows\system32\echo<br /><br />C:\&gt;echo. ekko1&amp;pushd c:\windows\system32&amp;echo. ekko2&amp;popd<br />&nbsp;ekko1<br />'echo.' is not recognized as an internal or external command,<br />operable program or batch file.<br /><br />C:\&gt;del c:\windows\system32\echo<br /><br />C:\&gt;echo. ekko1&amp;pushd c:\windows\system32&amp;echo. ekko2&amp;popd<br />&nbsp;ekko1<br />&nbsp;ekko2</code></pre></div><br />Then I run it from a batch file, with same result:<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>C:\&gt;copy con a.cmd<br />@echo off<br />echo. ekko1&amp;pushd c:\windows\system32&amp;echo. ekko2&amp;popd<br />type NUL&gt;c:\windows\system32\echo<br />echo. ekko1&amp;pushd c:\windows\system32&amp;echo. ekko2&amp;popd<br />del c:\windows\system32\echo<br />echo. ekko1&amp;pushd c:\windows\system32&amp;echo. ekko2&amp;popd<br />^Z<br />        1 file(s) copied.<br /><br />C:\&gt;a.cmd<br /> ekko1<br /> ekko2<br /> ekko1<br />'echo.' is not recognized as an internal or external command,<br />operable program or batch file.<br /> ekko1<br /> ekko2</div></blockquote><br />This suggest the following search order for executable commands:<br />1. current directory<br />2. internal commands<br />3. directories referenced in the path variable<br /><br />Alternatives:<br />Echo\ - seems to be unacceptable as well since someone could try &quot;echo\hello world&quot; while having a directory named &quot;echo&quot; with file named &quot;hello&quot; in it.<br /><br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>C:\&gt;echo\Hello World<br />Hello World<br /><br />C:\&gt;md echo&amp;type NUL&gt;echo\hello<br /><br />C:\&gt;echo\Hello World<br />'echo\Hello' is not recognized as an internal or external command,<br />operable program or batch file.<br /><br />C:\&gt;del echo\hello&amp;rd echo<br /><br />C:\&gt;echo\Hello World<br />Hello World</code></pre></div><br />So there could be hidden traps in other options as well.<br />I found these options appear to work but which one is best and why?<br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>C:\&gt;echo.<br /><br /><br />C:\&gt;echo/<br /><br /><br />C:\&gt;echo\<br /><br /><br />C:\&gt;echo:<br /><br /><br />C:\&gt;echo+<br /><br /><br />C:\&gt;echo=<br /><br /><br />C:\&gt;echo;<br /><br /><br />C:\&gt;echo,</code></pre></div>
<br />If we find a reliable option then I would adapt this to all dostips pages, but I would want to be sure.
<br />Thanks a lot for your input.  I'll get back on this.</div>

<br />
<br />I suggest that if a character is acceptable to Windows as being part of a file name, then that character cannot be safely used as a &quot;suffix&quot; to ECHO, otherwise CMD.EXE will trawl through the current directory and then the %PATH% trying to find &quot;ECHO+&quot; with an executable extension.
<br />(I have not tested this for all possibilities, but I am fairly confident of my theory.)

				<div class="content">Ok, i tested it again, and this are my results<br>
<br>
These one fails always (command can not be found)
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>echo{

These one fails, if files exists like echo*.bat, the * is one of "[]+"
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>echo[
echo]
echo+

This, often used, but it will call "echo.bat" if the file exists.<br>
If only a file named "echo" (without extension) exists, then it failed completly with an error message
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>echo.

These one fails, if a file in the current directory exists named my.bat

echo:\..\my.bat
echo.\..\my.bat

<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>echo/?

Ok, now we have a problem, there is only one usable character left.   <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":?" title="Confused"> <br>

Most likely, that delayed expansion work after tokens merged to &quot;supertokens&quot; like command or text stream (list of parameters), and each &quot;supertoken&quot; expand separately…<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>jeb wrote:</cite>Not the &quot;echo(&quot; is the problem, it fails because of the &quot;)&quot; in <span style="color: #FF4000">!str:0=)!</span></div></blockquote>Yes, the problem is in separate &quot;(&quot; char before, that toggle the block flag. &quot;(&quot; not detected as trigger in the middle or at the end of word, where it is equivalent of ordinary letter. Each another &quot;(&quot; trigger increment block counter. If the block flag is active, interpreter find &quot;)&quot; in each char as block end (quote (&quot;) mute this effect), and if found - select block and decrement counter. If counter=0, block flag is disable and &quot;)&quot; char is equivalent of ordinary letter.<br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>&nbsp;@echo off<br />SETLOCAL EnableDelayedExpansion<br /><br />set username)<br />(<br />set username)<br />set username)<br /><br />--- OUTPUT ----<br />&nbsp;Environment variable username) not defined<br />USERNAME=MyName<br />Environment variable username) not defined </code></pre></div><br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>jeb wrote:</cite> <blockquote><div><cite>amel27 wrote:</cite>but how tokenizer work with ECHO. now?<br />for /f &quot;delims=&quot; %%a in ('&quot;echo.!str:0=F!&quot;') do echo %%a<br /></div></blockquote>The &quot;echo.&quot; doesn't see the &quot;!str:0=F!&quot;, because the expansion of the delayed expression is just before the FOR-Loop starts the &quot;echo.&quot; in a new cmd.exe. </div></blockquote>delayed expression start twice - but each of them BEFORE run new cmd.exe:<br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>&nbsp;@echo off<br />set &quot;var=F0!var!&quot;<br /><br />SETLOCAL EnableDelayedExpansion<br />echo 1:<br />for /f &quot;delims=&quot; %%a in ('&quot;set var=&amp; echo:!var!&quot;') do echo %%a<br />echo 2:<br />for /f &quot;delims=&quot; %%a in ('&quot;echo:!var:0=F!&amp; echo:^^^!var:0=F^^^!&quot;') do echo %%a <br /><br />--- OUTPUT ----<br />1:<br />F0F0!var!<br />2:<br />FFF0!var!<br />FF!var! </code></pre></div></div>
