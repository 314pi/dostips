				<h3>Deleting specific lines from a text file</h3>

				<div class="content">Hi all,<br>
<br>
I had two text files one is whole and the other is part.txt<br>
<br>
Here is the content of whole.txt
<ul>
<li>From<br>
\T501-08815-0103\Application_Signing\Signed_Schemes\QA_Infra-SL_0102_Signed_T3\<br>
 <br>
     .500006011000.S3S <br>
     .500007011000.S3S <br>
     .500008011000.S3S <br>
     .500009011000.S3S <br>
     .500010011000.S3S<br>
     .500011011000.S3S  <br>
     .500012011000.S3S <br>
     .500014011000.S3S <br>
     .500015011800.S3S <br>
     .500016011000.S3S <br>
     .500028011201.S3S<br>
     .500072011000.S3S  <br>
     .500129010200.S3S <br>
     .500134010100.S3S <br>
     .500142010100.S3S <br>
     .500144010100.S3S</li> 
 </ul>

Here is the part.txt<br>

<ul>
<li>50001101<br>
50007201</li>
</ul>

Now my task is to remove two lines from whole.txt based upon the part.txt as search criteria<br>
<br>
I have the below code to do the job.<br>

<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>findstr /x /v /G: part.txt whole.txt &gt;new.txt
</code></pre></div>

it did not work and I know that because of the part.txt only have partial string matching the lines in whole.txt<br>
If I modified the part.txt as below<br>
     .500011011000.S3S <br>
     .500072011000.S3S <br>
<br>
run the above script again it shall delete the lines based upon the part.txt since    /X   Print lines that match exactly.<br>
However, I only have part.txt as below
<ul>
<li>50001101<br>
50007201</li>
</ul>

How can I do this deletion <br>
Thanks</div>

So what is the next logical step to test in your code?<br>
<br>
You also asked this same question last month.<br>

I would be more than happy to see the two possibilities... <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> <br>

<br>
DosTips.com is not RentACoder.com. It's a support forum where volunteers spend their free time to help others. Free time that they don't want to waste. Of course they write some lines of code to give you an idea of how things work out. But they expect that you try to understand the code and that you ask in case something still isn't clear to you. They won't answer the same question again and again only if people are too lazy to learn from the answers they have been already given.<br>
<br>
DosTips is not Facebook. If the only reason for your questions is to ask questions, thoughtlessly and only because you're bored, then you should rather use your time to learn.<br>
<br>
The DosTips forum is no replacement for a tutorial and getting answers here does not protect you from learning by yourown. Batch consists of ~50 frequently used commands. Certainly not too much for you to learn in the past 12 months that you're here. The HELP command gives you an overview, the /? option passed to a specific command gives you extended informations (e.g. FINDSTR /?). Furthermore you'll find the command index on the top of this site, besides of a lot of more useful informations and example code.<br>
