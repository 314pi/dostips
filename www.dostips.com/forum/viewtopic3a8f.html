				<div class="content">HI Folks -<br>
<br>
One of my clients recently migrated all of their content they had on a network share over to OneDrive for business. This includes various data integration pieces as well. This particular FP&amp;A team is very inpatient therefore I feel as if they will just ignore the fact OneDrive needs to synch before the latest data is available for other members of the team.<br>
<br>
With that said, is there an easy way to check whether or not a file is done synchronizing? I've checked some of the logs and there really isn't any rhyme or reason to them - at least enough for me to write a piece of code to check synch status. Has anyone had success doing this?<br>
<br>
The reason I ask is there are two MS Access databases that take a bi of time to synch due to the size of them - all other files synch relatively quickly. <br>
<br>
Thanks!</div>
