				<div class="content">I currently don't have access to a Windows machine at the moment, so I can't test or verify. But I think I see a couple problems with aGerman's code.<br>
<br>
1) The last quote must be escaped, else the closing parenthesis is treated as a string literal. I don't think that code will run at all. <span style="color: #800000">My mistake. The code should run just fine because the preceding %\n% escapes the end of the line, which is stripped, and then the next character is also escaped, which happens to be the quote.</span><br>
<br>
2) The commas should not require escaping, unless you are worried about the <a href="viewtopicf83f.html?f=3&amp;t=1972#p9062" class="postlink">XP FOR /F bug</a>. If you do want the code to be safe on XP, then all token delimiters must be escaped. In this case that would be commas and spaces. Disregarding the XP bug, FOR /F should not require token delimiters to be escaped or quoted. It is only the simple FOR command that uses token delimiters as the iteration delimiter.<br>
<br>
If I were to write aGerman's code, I would use USEBACKQ and substitute ' for " so that I don't have to worry about escaping the quotes.<br>
<br>
I generally only use the FOR /F &lt;LF&gt; multi line string trick if I have a delimited string that I want to iterate, in which case I would use expansion find/replace to substitute &lt;LF&gt; for the delimiter, all within the IN() clause.<br>
<br>
For example (again, untested):
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>@echo off
setlocal
set "str=1,Martini Shaker|2,Wine Bottle|3,Beer Glass"

(set LF=^
%= This creates a Line Feed (0x0A) character - DO NOT ALTER =%
)

setlocal enableDelayedExpansion
for %%L in ("!LF!") do for /f "tokens=1,2 delims=," %%A in ("!str:|=%%~L!") do (
  if "!!" == "" endlocal  %= pop SETLOCAL stack only if delayed expansion is enabled to preserve any ! that may be in the strings =%
  echo T1=%%A  T2=%%B
)
</code></pre></div>

If I want to iterate a series of string literals embedded within my source code, then I generally combine the simple FOR with FOR /F. But of course this only works if none of the strings contain * or ?
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>@echo off
for %%S in (
  "1,Martini Shaker"
  "2,Wine Bottle"
  "3,Beer Glass"
) do for /f "tokens=1,2 delims=," %%A in ("%%~S") do echo T1=%%A  T2=%%B
</code></pre></div>

That was surprising for me, too. And for whatever reason the unescaped spaces work flawlessly even if the commas do not.<br>
Output with unescaped commas (Win10, 32bit):
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>T1=1 Martini Shaker T2=
T1=2 Wine Bottle T2=

				<div class="content">Hmmm. That means the parser must be substituting space for the comma, in which case I suspect that any contiguous string of unquoted, unescaped token delimiters will be replaced by a single space.<br>
<br>
I knew this was done when FOR /F iterates the output of a command. I thought this was part of packaging up the IN clause for insertion into a CMD /C command. I didn't think it applied to string processing. But apparently it is universal to all FOR /F IN() clauses.<br>
<br>
I don't think the SO command parsing rules address this point properly. I'll have to wade through them again.<br>

I think the bolded line should be modified to state that only unquoted, unescaped token delimiters are affected<br>

Yes Dave, that is what I am doing already.  I should have put that in my original post.  For some reason I thought it was possible to do it with a single FOR /F command. I could have sworn Antonio had posted something like I was trying a few years ago.  I even remember posting in the thread.<br>
<br>
I did get this to work.
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>@echo off
setLocal EnableDelayedExpansion
set lf=^


for /F ^"eol^=^

tokens^=^1^,^2^ delims^=^,^" %%G in ("1,A B!lf!2,C D!lf!3,E F") do echo T1=%%G T2=%%H
pause</code></pre></div>
But I was hoping to list each grouping on its own line because they will be larger then this example and was hoping for some readability in the code.</div>

Try this. I still can't test, but I think it should work:
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>@echo off
setlocal

(set ;=^^^
%= This creates an escaped Line Feed - DO NOT ALTER =%
)

For /f "usebackq tokens=1,2 delims=," %%A in ('^
1^,line 1%;%
2^,line 2%;%
3^,line 3'
) do echo T1=%%A  T2=%%B
</code></pre></div>

The ; variable should contain <strong class="text-strong"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">^&lt;LF&gt;</span></strong><br>
<br>
So the IN clause should effectively look like <strong class="text-strong"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">('^string1^&lt;LF&gt;&lt;LF&gt;string2^&lt;LF&gt;&lt;LF&gt;string3')</span></strong></div>

				<div class="content">Doh! Of course. I edited the post.<br>
<br>
The other main difference is the use of a simple definition for ; as opposed to a fairly complex definition for \n
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>(set LF=^
%= This creates a Line Feed - DO NOT ALTER =%
)
set ^"\n=^^^%LF%%LF%^%LF%%LF%^^"
REM \n = ^&lt;LF&gt;&lt;LF&gt;^

vs.

(set ;=^^^
%= This creates an escaped Line Feed - DO NOT ALTER =%
)
REM ; = ^&lt;LF&gt;
</code></pre></div>

But the end result is the same - the IN() clause is parsed as one string with multiple &lt;LF&gt; terminated lines.<br>
<br>
One potential advantage is the use of \n escapes the line feed and the first character of the next line, but the use of ; only escapes the line feed.<br>
<br>
I'm thinking this simpler syntax could be used for macro definition as well, though I would probably use \n for the variable name instead of ;</div>

				<div class="content">Your idea of using your technique for macro definitions sounds great. I remember the original explanation by jeb. He told that the \n variable expands as you said but that it would be required because in the end the two line feeds generate a single line feed the same way as you originally define the LF variable. That seems to be wrong or at least not necessary <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_surprised.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":o" title="Surprised"> <br>

Is just a more pleasing way of writing
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>echo Hello^

Both the above only get parsed once. The same is true with the IN() clause in earlier posts. But the macro must be parsed twice, once to define the macro, and again to execute the macro. So the more complicated definition is required to define a macro.<br>
