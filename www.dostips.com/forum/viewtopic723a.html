Problem was, i also wanted to synch the effects with the music... big mistake. Manually timing the first minute or so was ok, but after that it just got more and more painful and about 3-4 minutes in I just gave up... <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> <br /><br />Anyway... I would be happy if some of you could run this (<strong class="text-strong">run demo.bat</strong>) and tell me if the synching with music is working (calculating time passed is done with code borrowed from einstein1969, which I'm sure works, but there are many aspects involved in synching). Basically it should be easy to determine if synching works; when the tune changes in some way, the effects should change too. Also,does speed seem to be ok, or is it lagging?<br /><br />Here's a link for download (file size is due to the mp3): <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/file/af5656ss58l37jx/lovechild.zip" class="postlink">http://www.mediafire.com/file/af5656ss58l37jx/lovechild.zip</a><br /><br /><img src="https://ucfff4567e1249440a5d62a1de01.dl.dropboxusercontent.com/cd/0/inline/ATbtM3VfaO_sNmNS6gaBPFHGL9ANXYSITF9tN_k506NulETsSC7LywWxCeA-NPG4FUCx2AB1HTQufJXihMrGWjDbCieQymcXvnoJ0L1sooYXLzIxC7FM88nUkISgmwRKEHvvkEAzuN7jn3uKF4WXprEUdn4kZQksKZNCKOM3rkC5BQYTbsGwgddtzWbaTOTrcvA/file" class="postimage" alt="Image" /></div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for running!<br /><br />Hmm, that's strange about the window size,any idea why that might be? I'm just using a regular call to &quot;mode&quot; to set the window size.<br /><br />Fluttery motion does not sound good either, but atleast the synchronization is ok then... <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> This thing runs quite smoothly on my old Windows 7 machine, but I don't recall ever trying cmdgfx on a Win10 machine. Hmmm. Just to be sure, can you check that no other process is hogging a lot of the CPU time? (On my machine, Firefox likes to use a lot of CPU, I sometimes have to kill it). It seems that Windows does not give a high priority to the cmd window. Also, antivirus programs might slow it down, especially if running in sandbox mode.<br /><br />How fluttery is it? Would you say it's even worse than the gif animation above?</div>

				<div class="content">Penpen: aha, yes that would be my next question actually. Because the script calls &quot;cmdwiz setfont 7&quot; in the initial phase in order to ensure that bitmap font 7 is used before calling &quot;mode&quot; (to ensure a specific window size). So I guess that means that &quot;cmdwiz setfont&quot; does not work (on yours and aGerman's platform)?! Are you also running Windows 10?<br /><br />Can you confirm that &quot;cmdwiz setfont [0-9]&quot; does not work? How about carlos old bg utility? (&quot;bg font [0-9]&quot; ?<br /><br />I've seen neorobin use some sort of regkey method to set the font, perhaps I will have to use that instead...</div>

I looks rather like the motion is a little too fast and is adjusted quite often. Because of the helical movement of the kaleidoscope it looks like it steps back before it moves forward again. But that might be an optical illusion. Most likely the rotation simply stops for some milliseconds.<br /><br />Steffen</div>

I temporarily &quot;fixed&quot; this by re-uploading the archive with bg.exe and calling that to set the font. But I have to look into what the problem is. I have confirmed that &quot;cmdwiz setfont&quot; works both on my Win7, 64 bit and my Win 8.1, 32 bit machines. I don't have a Win10 machine to test on at the moment. Quite strange that it just stops working there. Also, the font code in cmdwiz is pretty much taken straight from bg's code (credited as such too), and uses the same API SetConsoleFont etc. So it's kind of strange. If you reach some insight into the problem I'd be happy to know.<br /><br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>aGerman wrote:</cite>I looks rather like the motion is a little too fast and is adjusted quite often.

First I couldn't see this on my machine at all, but when I tried slowing the effect down quite a bit it was visible. This makes me suspect that the effect is running pretty slow on your machine. Might be something wrong with my time-interval measurements for microseconds. Could you try this: on line 125 in demo.bat, change  cmdgfx &quot;&quot; knW12  into  cmdgfx &quot;&quot; knW0 . <br /><br />Does that make any impact when running?  (to skip the possibly annoying initial dead screen effect, comment out the CALL to the :STATIC label)</div>

				<div class="content">Ok, so even W0 didn't make it faster? Or just not less fluttery? Just one more thing, to get an idea of how fast it's running on your machine, on line 124, could you remove the word &quot;skip&quot; and change !a! into !CNT! (so it looks like): <div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>start /B /High cmdgfx_gdi &quot;!OUTP:~1,-1! &amp; !MONS! &amp; !FADE! &amp;&nbsp; text a 0 0 _!CNT!_ 1,1 &amp; !TTEXT! &amp; !TORUS!&quot; f!FNT!:0,0,!W!,!H!</code></pre></div><br />Then run (without intro effect) for, say, *approximately* 10 seconds and note how high the value is in the top left. On my Win 7 machine I get around 800, so my FPS is around 80. (that's with W12, if I run with W0 I get an FPS around 130)</div>

				<div class="content">Yeah that seems to be the culprit. Get ~35 FPS. I think it should be minimum 50 FPS to run smoothly.<br /><br />Steffen</div>

				<div class="content">Ouch, that sucks... This thing won't look very good at all when it runs at less than half the speed it's supposed to... ! Wonder why, could it be Win 10 related? Do you have any antivirus software running? (some of them do a quick scan every time an executable is run).<br /><br />(About the W flag, this is the (minimum) wait in milliseconds per frame. So W12 is 1000/12 = 83, which means the target frame rate for this effect is 83 FPS, which is approximately what I get.)<br /><br />Could you try one more thing? The new version of cmdgfx allows running as a server, which takes away the startup overhead. Save this in the same folder as the demo as server.bat and run it. Does it perform better? (if not, how about with W0? As a final attempt, remove or comment out the line: cmdgfx &quot;&quot; knW9 completely.
