				<div class="content">I've released version 3.0   <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" /><br />As always, the new code is at the top of the first post in this thread.<br /><br />This new version is a significant release with lots of new features.<br /><br />1) The keyboard game controls are now user configurable. You can choose between a 2 key configuration (left/right), or 4 key configuration (left/right/up/down). You can also map the movement keys as you see fit. This change should make Ed Dyreen and Aacini happy  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br /><br />2) The graphic display is also user configurable. You can choose what characters are used to represent the elements of the playing field. Note that extended ASCII codes ban be used by using the &lt;Alt&gt; key with the numeric keypad.<br /><br />3) Keyboard control and graphic display user preferences are automatically stored in the %USERPROFILE%\Snake folder.<br /><br />4) You can watch a &quot;movie&quot; instant replay of the previous game. You get to choose the display speed of the replay.<br /><br />5) The game now tracks and displays high scores for each of the Difficulty (speed) levels. You can watch a &quot;movie&quot; instant replay of any of the High Scores. Again, you get to choose the display speed of the replay.<br /><br />6)  I eliminated the 0 - Unplayable speed option.<br /><br /><br />Everything seems to be working well, but its quite a bit of new code. Bug reports are most welcome.<br /><br />I hope everyone enjoys the new version.<br /><br /><br />Dave Benham</div>

I don't know how I managed to recognize that I needed to put the 2 key vs. 4 key option in the &quot;movie&quot;, yet forgot to do the same for the key mapping. I'll fix that and post version 3.1<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />Dave</div>

				<div class="content">OK, the bug has been fixed. The key mappings are now included in the game logs. <br /><br />Thanks again foxidrive.<br /><br />One thing I forgot to mention - The code includes a getString routine that allows the user to enter an entire string. It supports the backspace and enter keys. It works, but I ended up not using it. I was thinking of letting the user enter a name to go with the high score, and to have user named game log files. The string entry worked well, but I thought the overall user interface became to complicated, so I abandoned it.<br /><br /><br />Dave</div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>foxidrive wrote:</cite>Nice one.

A Loaded game will never update the high scores. That way we can safely share movies.<br /><br />So I will be using the getString function after all  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br /><br /><br />Dave Benham</div>
