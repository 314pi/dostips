So for example I expect <strong class="text-strong">&quot;&quot; a ---</strong> to be counted as 3 arguments, and <strong class="text-strong">&quot;&quot; a</strong> as just 2. Sorry for the confusion.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>aGerman wrote:</cite>I'm afraid the answer is NO.<br />REM is the only command that is able to catch the arguments %* as is.<br /></div></blockquote><br />I am aware of the REM redirection trick to get %*. In fact, I was wondering if I could get the count in advance, so that I could then get the individual %1, %2 etc arguments as well in one shot, as opposed to (re)using a temp file for each.<br /><br />Guess my original question can be reduced to how to check whether %1 is present or not, in a way safe against odd input like single &quot;, ^&quot;, ^&amp; etc. Since that's a lighter requirement than literally retrieving %1 itself, I was hoping there might be some easier workaround.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Liviu</div>

				<div class="content">Not only is it susceptible to command injection, it can also completely miss the parameter.<br /><br /><strong class="text-strong"><em class="text-italics">&quot;one&amp;rem &quot;</strong></em>  (quotes included) will be reported as no argument, and it executes the REM command. The one is stripped because it occurs after the last quote, and the rem command could just as easily be something destructive.<br /><br />I really don't think it is possible to safely test for 1 or more arguments without using the REM echoed to a file trick.<br /><br />Here is a clean looking script that safely loads all of the arguments into an arg &quot;array&quot; using the REM trick. There is a space at the end of the temp file that protects against stripping trailing control characters from the argument.

Somehow thought it couldn't be that easy <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" /> And it takes down any following parameters as well.<br /><br />Now, I don't think that'd be much of a problem in my particular use-case, though it's surely disappointing in a more academical sense. What I am actually after is basically &quot;tokenize&quot; the _beginning_ of the %* line in order to simulate an %* &quot;shift&quot; (since the built-in one only shifts the individual %1, %2, etc arguments, but not %* itself). Suppose I wanted to write a simple loggedrun.cmd which would save one line per run to a designated logfile, to be invoked like<br /><br />loggedrun «logfile» «program-to-run» «program-arguments»<br /><br />In a different better world, loggedrun.cmd could contain just<br /><br />@setlocal<br />@set &quot;logfile=%~1&quot;<br />@rem _but_ 'shift' doesn't affect %*<br />@shift<br />@echo &gt;&gt;&quot;%logfile%&quot; %date% %time% starting: %*<br />@%*<br />@echo &gt;&gt;&quot;%logfile%&quot; %date% %time% done: %*<br />@endlocal<br /><br />But of course this wouldn't work as such in the cmd world. Firstly, shift doesn't update %*, and then cmd has its own parsing rules which are different from everybody else's. In my example, what comes before «program-to-run» is obviously intended for the batch file, and would follow the cmd rules. However the «program-arguments» part would be under the control of the target program command-line-parsing logic, and it would need to be literally passed as such by the batch file.<br /><br />Hope here was that combining the REM redirection trick for %*/%1/etc with some time-saving trick to extract the first &quot;cmd-compliant&quot; arguments would then allow me to remove those parts from %* and pass the rest thorugh unchanged.<br /><br />Since my particular case only involves the first parameters which are largely under my/user's control, I could rule out &quot;pathological&quot; values for those parameters, and make it work under that assumption. That said, it would obviously be more &quot;academically satisfying&quot; if there was a general solution to that, more efficient than one temp file per %1/%2/etc argument.<br /><br />Thanks again for all responses,<br />Liviu</div>

It's working otherwise, thank you, only nitpick is that &quot;rem %1&quot; should probably be &quot;rem [ %1 ]&quot; or such (and the ~5,-1 offsets adjusted accordingly) in order to handle oddities like /?, ^^.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Liviu</div>

One other corner case is that the 'for' loop would save the incorrect %1 when passed %a or similar as an argument, presumably because of some loop variable name clash. Didn't look into it much yet, but for whatever reason replacing it with<br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>for %%a in (%%a) do rem . %1.</code></pre></div><br />appears to work better under xp.sp3 at least.
