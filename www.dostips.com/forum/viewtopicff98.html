				<h3>A question about DosBox games......</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>14 Oct 2018 15:08</strong></div>

				<div class="content">I don't know if this is the appropriate place to ask this question, and if it isn't, can someone please refer me to a different forum...? I have downloaded DosBox for my computer, and can play a large number of games, including the Might and Magic series. I am trying to play the MS-Dos game King's Bounty. I downloaded it from a site, I believe it is called MyAbandonware.com - but after downloading King's Bounty and extracting the files, I click on the .exe file and get a message saying that the game will not run on my computer. I am curious as to why, and if there is something I can do to make the game playable. Can anyone help me?</div>

<br>
Regardless of that I would think you would have to run the program inside dosbox instead of trying to run it with your mouse</div>
