				<div class="content">Recently I saw the dbenham update <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/8537736/388389" class="postlink">here</a>. The macro comments are cool ,but I was thinking about an improvement.<br /><br />Here it is:<br /><br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>@echo off<br />set &quot;/:=goto :/%%&quot;<br /><br />%/:%<br />&nbsp; multi <br />&nbsp; line<br />&nbsp; comment<br />%:/%<br /><br />echo not commented 1<br /><br />%/:%<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;another <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;multi<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;line <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;comment<br />%:/%<br /><br />echo not commented 2</code></pre></div><br /><br />It uses one 'feature' of GOTO - you can put a single symbol (if it is not : ) in front of the label and the GOTO will still be able to find it (hope this is not something working only on my machine).Though  the leading % in the closing comment can be skipped (and also the one at the end in the closing comment) it triggers my OCD with it's lack of symetry <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":-D" title="Very Happy" /> .Also when ':' is the last symbol in the variable name substring or replacement are not started when the variable is used.<br />This looks almost like the comments in the &quot;serious&quot; programming languages. Even all kind of brackets can be used:<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>@echo off<br />set &quot;(:=goto :)%%&quot;<br /><br />echo not commented 1<br /><br />%(:%<br />&nbsp; multi <br />&nbsp; line<br />&nbsp; comment<br />%:)%<br /><br /><br />set &quot;&#91;:=goto :&#93;%%&quot;<br /><br /><br />%&#91;:%<br />&nbsp; another<br />&nbsp; multi <br />&nbsp; line <br />&nbsp; comment<br />%:&#93;%<br /><br />echo not commented 2</code></pre></div><br /><br />This gives me a feeling of a something closed...<br /><br /><br />The negative conditional comment also can be improved a little bit (in case multi line comment in a brackets context is needed):<br /><br /><br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>@echo off<br /><br />rem&#91;||(&#91;<br /><br />&nbsp;multi line<br />&nbsp;comment<br />&nbsp;<br />&#93;)<br /><br />echo not commented 1<br /><br />rem/||(/<br />&nbsp; another<br />&nbsp; comment<br />/)<br /><br />echo not commented 2</code></pre></div><br /><br />It also can be shorterened with a macros (and thus both techniques could be alligned with similar symbols):<br /><br /><br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>@echo off<br /><br />::comment macros<br />set &quot;&#91;=rem/||(&quot; &amp; set &quot;&#93;=)&quot;<br /><br />for /f %%a in ('echo comment tests') do (<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;echo not commented 1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;%&#91;%<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;multi <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;line <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;comment<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;%&#93;%<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; echo not commented 2<br />)<br /></code></pre></div><br /><br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>@echo off<br /><br />::comment macros<br />set &quot;(=rem/||(&quot; &amp; set &quot;)=)&quot;<br /><br />for /f %%a in ('echo comment tests') do (<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;echo not commented 1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;%(%<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;multi <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;line <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;comment<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;%)%<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; echo not commented 2<br />)</code></pre></div><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Of course it is a matter of a personal taste , may be it's only me who find these more pleasing.<br /><br /><br />And the final result:<br /><br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>@echo off<br /><br />::GOTO comment macro<br />set &quot;&#91;:=goto :&#93;%%&quot;<br />::brackets comment macros<br />set &quot;&#91;=rem/||(&quot; &amp; set &quot;&#93;=)&quot;<br /><br />::testing<br />echo not commented 1<br /><br />%&#91;:%<br />&nbsp; multi <br />&nbsp; line<br />&nbsp; comment outside of brackets<br />%:&#93;%<br /><br />echo not commented 2<br /><br />%&#91;:%<br />&nbsp; second multi <br />&nbsp; line<br />&nbsp; comment outside of brackets<br />%:&#93;%<br /><br />::GOTO macro cannot be used inside for<br />for %%a in (first second) do (<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; echo first not commented line of the %%a execution<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; %&#91;%<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; multi line<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; comment<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; %&#93;%<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; echo second not commented line of the %%a execution<br />)</code></pre></div></div>

				<div class="content">A really great idea! It never ceases to amaze me that we can still make progress like this with this good old batch language.<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Of course it is a matter of a personal taste</div></blockquote><br />Indeed! I personally favor using :# for comments instead of ::, as the # character is used for comments by most other scripting languages. Using it in batch files like everywhere else, helps me when switching from one language to another.<br /><br />It's easy to adapt your block comments to use the # character.<br />Note how I also changed the loop-specific ones to use parenthesis instead of brackets. I think this makes it more intuitive as to which macro is for goto comments, and which one is for use in (loops).<br /><br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>@echo off<br /><br />:# Goto comment macro<br />set &quot;#:=goto :#%%&quot;<br />:# Parentheses comment macros<br />set &quot;#(=rem.||(&quot; &amp; set &quot;)#=)&quot;<br /><br />:# testing<br />echo not commented 1<br /><br />%#:%<br />&nbsp; multi <br />&nbsp; line<br />&nbsp; comment outside of brackets<br />%:#%<br /><br />echo not commented 2<br /><br />%#:%<br />&nbsp; second multi <br />&nbsp; line<br />&nbsp; comment outside of brackets<br />%:#%<br /><br />echo not commented 3<br /><br />:# GOTO macro cannot be used inside for loop<br />for %%a in (first second) do (<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; echo first not commented line of the %%a execution<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; %#(%<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; multi line<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; comment<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; %)#%<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; echo second not commented line of the %%a execution<br />)</code></pre></div></div>

				<div class="content">Hi  npocmaka_, I like this. Thanks. A couple of minor comments...<br>
<br>
I found that the closing % is in fact needed at the end of the block, as post #1 is currently written, otherwise giving<br>
The system cannot find the batch label specified - /%<br>
<br>
For the same reason, if the first block has the closing % but the second doesn't, infinite loop <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> The second block keeps returning to the label in the first block. Recalling dbenham saying "Although it is generally recommended that :labels are unique within a batch script, it really is OK to embed multiple comments like this within the same batch script" I was curious how it might resolve the "ambiguity". It would appear (and seems logical) that goto looks "downward" for a label, then wraps around to the top of the file if not found below the goto, which is consistent with the infinite loop's progression.<br>
<br>
OTOH I found, as you suggested, that the opening % can be omitted at the end of the block, though I agree with you in preference for "symmetry."<br>
<br>
All of that is based on your definition<br>
set "/:=goto :/%%"<br>
<br>
IF instead the definition is<br>
set "/:=goto :/%"<br>
then you can (and should) omit the closing % at the end of blocks ( %:/ works ) but I agree with you to use the first set definition, and just close with %:/%.<br>
<br>
I've been told that I write long posts and smart important people may grow weary reading them. I hope that everything above is of interest or is meaningful to someone, and if not, I apologize. I could have just said "Hey npoc, the closing % is actually needed on post 1" but thought I could add more value. Anyway, stop reading now <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile"> However, for the intensely curious minds that enjoy trivial details and anecdotes:<br>
<br>
I tested the first /: example in post #1 above, saved as COMM_BLK.BAT and run from a command line.<br>
A curious thing happened; after running, I typed the letter C and F8 key.<br>
On Windows 7 it retrieves the command line normally.<br>
On XP SP3 hitting C and F8 does not retrieve it. I wonder why. However you can still up-arrow to the command history item, and it does show in F7. (Microsoft Windows XP [Version 5.1.2600])<br>
However if I renamed from COMM_BLK.BAT to COMM_BAK.BAT, then C and F8 gets it normally in XP. Just curious; maybe a small former bug.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi,<br>
<br>
an even shorter and completely symmetric solution for multi line comments outside of ()-blocks seems to be this:
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>set :=goto %%

%:%
  comment lines
  ...
  a little weird that comment opening and closing symbol are identical,
  but you can do this also in C with /*/ ... /*/
%:%
</code></pre></div>
This works because searching for a labels happens in a very early phase of the "parser" (for me, a too ambitious denomination in the context of cmd.exe).<br>
<br>
Another comment related question: It seems to me that outside of ()-blocks a plain ')' at the beginning of a line works like '::' (with the same restrictions). Any experiences if this assumption is correct?</div>

Absolutely, although the restrictions are quite different from those for ::<br>
<br>
I've documented the behavior at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/4095133/1012053" class="postlink">How does the Windows Command Interpreter (CMD.EXE) parse scripts?</a> in my Phase 2 edits.
<blockquote><div><cite>StackOverflow wrote:</cite>
<ul>
  <li>If the parenthesis counter is 0 and the parser is looking for a command, then ) functions similar to a REM statement as long as it is immediately followed by a token delimiter, special character, newline, or end-of-file
  <ul>
    <li>All special characters lose their meaning except ^ (line concatenation is possible)</li>
    <li>Once the end of the logical line is reached, the entire "command" is discarded.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>

Here are examples of working "comments":
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>@echo off
) This is a comment
)=This is a comment
),This is a comment
);This is a comment
)&gt;This is a comment
)&lt;This is a comment
)|This is a comment
)&amp;This is a comment
echo OK &amp; ) OK is printed and the rest is a comment

) This multiline comment^
  works just fine!
</code></pre></div>

But the following attempt at a comment fails because the character following the ) is not acceptable:
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>@echo off
)This gives a syntax error
</code></pre></div>

				<div class="content">Multiple-line comments in batch scripts is certainly the interesting topic. Time ago I was inspired to implement them using internal facilities of the batch interpreter. I have thoroughly read this thread and other links to SO pages. To be honest, all the options with macros like %[:% and %:]% and others are variations (or syntax sugar) of the basic structure. In my opinion this is the best attempt to enter multiline comments to batch script
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>rem.||(
)
</code></pre></div>

I found couple of limitations:<br>
-- blank lines after :label within these structures are not allowed and throw error "The syntax of the command is incorrect."<br>
-- some problems with closing parentheses if they are not consistent. The exception is the same "The syntax of the command is incorrect."</div>

				<div class="author">by <strong>dbenham</strong></div>
				<div class="content">There are additional restrictions to REM.||( ... )<br>
<br>
The content within the brackets (the comment) is fully parsed through <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/4095133/1012053" class="postlink">phase 3</a>. So anything that can cause an error in those phases can be problematic with this technique.<br>
<br>
Of particular concern is the fact that any IF or FOR command must have valid syntax, else you get a fatal syntax error.<br>
<br>
For example:
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>@echo off

rem.||(
  if a == b is a valid comment
)
echo The above comment works just fine

rem.||(
  if this is the comment then fatal error
)
echo Not excecuted
</code></pre></div>

Also, a special character may be needed after a closing ), depending on whether the parens are parsed as a block
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>@echo off

rem.||(
  This (is not a problem)
  (nor is this) &amp; a problem
)
echo The above comment works just fine

rem.||(
  (but this) causes a fatal syntax error
)
echo Not excecuted
</code></pre></div>

<br>
One potentially nice attribute of this technique is that the comments are all printed if ECHO is ON, which is consistent with normal REM behavior.<br>

I agree. I only enjoyed that it is possible to use identical symbols for start and end of a comment <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":)" title="Smile">. <br>
<br>
My proposal can also make problems when I use syntax highlighting im Vim: It's possible to define a <em class="text-italics">syntax region</em> with identical start and end symbols and even to replace them (by <em class="text-italics">conceal</em>) with different (!) characters (e. g. '{' and '}'). But the highlighting can fail depending on your position in the file, because Vim (and I think other editors too) only parse a limited part of the file for syntax recognition. <br>
<br>
By the way, another possibility (in a sense similar to /* ... */) would be to use <div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>%:%
comment lines 
:%:</code></pre></div> Maybe this prohibits these problems, because start and end symbol are unique and so Vim cannot mix them up.<br>
