I considered using it instead of a signal file, but I read that some people had problems getting it to behave properly, and also lack of XP support was a problem. NET SEND is available for XP, and I think that worked better.<br /><br /><br />Dave Benham</div>

I am proud of the work.<br /><br />The controller process indeed uses negligible CPU resources since it spends most of its time within the XCOPY command waiting for a key press, consuming zero CPU.<br /><br />But the game process does use a lot of CPU, I think necessarily. When a game is in progress, it is in an infinite FOR loop that never waits for input, so it consumes 100% of a CPU core. My machine is a quad core, and the task manager reports that the game process uses 25% of my CPU resources (100% of 1 core). All the other processes, including the console host, use negligible resources.<br /><br />When in the menu system, waiting for user input, the game process uses between 6% and 9% of my CPU resources, and the console host uses between 7% and 9% of the game resources. All other processes use virtually 0%. I'm not sure why the console host behaves this way. The game process doesn't use 100% of a core while in the menu because it is in a GOTO loop. Significant time is spent performing file IO while reading nothing from the end of the key file, and while searching for the GOTO label.<br /><br /><br />Dave Benham</div>

The only universal delay I'm aware of is PING, and the minimum delay is ~1 second. But the slowest interval I use in snake is 0.2 second. The fastest interval is 0.03 second. It is also important for the timing to be precise in order to achieve smooth animation.<br /><br />Feel free to modify SNAKE.BAT to make your own version with a sleep mechanism. But that is not something I will ever add.<br /><br /><br />Dave Benham</div>

I'm impressed.<br /><br />If you look at my SNAKE.BAT code (and the explanations I've already written describing how it works), then you will see that I am already addressing your concerns, although I've implemented it in a different way.<br /><br />My code already is doing parallel processing. But I am using START instead of pipes. I have once process for input, and another for logic and display. I don't need parrallel processes to improve speed - I'm already getting 33 frames per second. The 2nd process is only needed to read key presses in a non blocking way.<br /><br />I also have a screen buffer to minimize flicker. Instead of using a text file, I store the screen image in variables, one variable per line. If you look at my draw macro, you will see that it simply loops through the screen variables using a FOR /L loop and echos each line.<br /><br />I went ahead and modified my draw macro to echo each  screen to a text file, and then use TYPE to display the screen as you did. That actually made the flicker much worse.<br /><br />When I play your game, I actually see flicker in the top wall.<br /><br />I don't think it is possible to eliminate flicker if the display requires a CLS before each refresh. At some point the entire console will logically be entirely black, which will always contribute some amount of flicker.<br /><br />The amount of flicker is a complex relationship between the frame rate of the game, coupled with the refresh rate of the display monitor.<br /><br />The only way to eliminate flicker is to somehow reposition the cursor position to prior lines on the screen, and write new information without clearing the rest of the screen. But there is no cabability to do that with native batch on a Windows machine.<br /><br /><br />Dave Benham</div>

				<div class="content">Version 3.5 is now available in the first post of this thread.<br /><br />There are 2 major enhancements:<br /><br />1) The growth rate of the snake is now configurable to any value from 1 to 10, with a dafault value of 1 segment growth per food eaten. The higher growth rates allow the game to get interesting much sooner. The growth rate option is available within the Graphic options menu. High scores are maintained independently for each growth rate played.<br /><br />Addition of the growth rate option required a modification to the saved game format. SNAKE 3.5 will automatically update existing saved games to the new format when it is launched.<br /><br />2) I've added support for Aacini's CursorPos.exe utility so as to eliminate the irritating screen flicker that results from the CLS during each screen refresh. CursorPos.exe allows the cursor position to be reset to the top left corner without having to clear the screen.<br /><br />The game will continue to play as before with screen flicker if CursorPos.exe is not present. I preserve this functionality so that the game can truly operate as pure batch using only internal and native external commands. But if you are willing to &quot;cheat&quot; and use a non-native external utility, then the game play is dramatically improved by simply placing a copy of CursorPos.exe in the same folder as SNAKE.BAT.<br /><br />The MakeCursorPos.bat script below can create the CursorPos.exe utility. The script combines code from two Aacini posts: <a href="viewtopic32b8.php?p=32241#p32241" class="postlink">Re: modern reply.exe created using only batch</a>, and <a href="viewtopic675a.php?p=17216#p17216" class="postlink">Advanced Batch features via auxiliary .exe programs</a>.<br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>@echo off<br />call :ExtractBinaryFile CursorPos.exe<br />exit /b<br /><br /><br />rem Extract Binary File from hexadecimal digits placed in a &quot;resource&quot; in this .bat file<br /><br />:ExtractBinaryFile filename.ext&#91;.cab&#93;<br />setlocal EnableDelayedExpansion<br />ECHO Creating %1, please wait...<br />set &quot;start=&quot;<br />set &quot;end=&quot;<br />for /F &quot;tokens=1,3 delims=:=&gt;&quot; %%a in ('findstr /N /B &quot;&lt;/*resource&quot; &quot;%~F0&quot;') do (<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;if not defined start (<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if &quot;%%~b&quot; equ &quot;%~1&quot; set start=%%a<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;) else if not defined end set end=%%a<br />)<br /><br />(for /F &quot;skip=%start% tokens=1* delims=:&quot; %%a in ('findstr /N &quot;^&quot; &quot;%~F0&quot;') do (<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;if &quot;%%a&quot; == &quot;%end%&quot; goto decodeHexFile<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;echo %%b<br />)) &gt; &quot;%~1.hex&quot;<br />:decodeHexFile<br /><br />rem Modified code based on :genchr subroutine<br />type nul &gt; t.tmp<br />(for /F &quot;usebackq&quot; %%a in (&quot;%~1.hex&quot;) do (<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;set input=%%a<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;set i=0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;for /L %%I in (0,2,120) do for %%i in (!i!) do if &quot;!input:~%%i,1!&quot; neq &quot;&quot; (<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; set hex=!input:~%%i,2!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; set /A i+=2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if &quot;!hex:~0,1!&quot; neq &quot;&#91;&quot; (<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;set /A chr=0x!hex!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;if not exist !chr!.chr call :genchr !chr!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;type !chr!.chr<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ) else (<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;for /L %%J in (1,1,5) do for %%i in (!i!) do if &quot;!input:~%%i,1!&quot; neq &quot;&#93;&quot; (<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; set &quot;hex=!hex!!input:~%%i,1!&quot;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; set /A i+=1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;if not exist 0.chr call :genchr 0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;for /L %%J in (1,1,!hex:~1!) do type 0.chr<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;set /A i+=1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; )<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;)<br />)) &gt; &quot;%~1&quot;<br />del *.chr<br />del t.tmp temp.tmp<br />del &quot;%~1.hex&quot;<br /><br />rem Expand created file if extension is .cab<br />set &quot;filename=%~1&quot;<br />if /I &quot;%filename:~-4%&quot; equ &quot;.cab&quot; (<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;expand &quot;%filename%&quot; &quot;%filename:~0,-4%&quot; &gt; NUL<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;del &quot;%filename%&quot;<br />)<br /><br />exit /B<br /><br /><br />:genchr<br />REM This code creates one single byte.
