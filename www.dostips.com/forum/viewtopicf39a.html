				<div class="content">Hi there!<br>
<br>
I was wondering if there is anyway to make the data input interface a bit more "attractive" with batch.<br>
<br>
Kind of a Windows box or something so that a normal user doesn't have to see the Command prompt.<br>
<br>
Thanks!</div>

				<div class="content">Windows has scripting languages like VBScript or JScript on board that can be run without a window and where you would use default dialog boxes instead. The fact that those are really only default dialogs makes it actually less flexible. However, cmd.exe (which is the interpreter for Batch scripts) is a console program and thus, runs in a text-based console window which is the user interface in that case. If you're not happy whith that console window I'd really recomment you to use another language. Sure, you could use hybrid scripts to display dialogs but that looks rather weird to users that expect to work with the console window in Batch.<br>

Can you give some more information?<br>
There is a Messagebox dialog that just displays a message or a question and you have buttons lik Yes, No or Yes,No, Cancel. There is also an Inputbox where you can fill in freetext. Another possibility is a BrowseForFolder dialog where you can pick up a folder out of an Explorer-like window.<br>

Of course. But in that case you may need an additional text file as interface between the two processes.<br>
