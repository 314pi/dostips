<br>
You address questions which are not directly relevant to my setting. All my binary files (which I intend to use) have "lines" (i.e. newline characters), and these "lines" are not to long for findstr (there is a length limit). So findstr definitely would work with my binary data. Therefore findstr would be useful for me––why do you wonder so much about this idea?<br>
<br>
Your script works fine with text files. (I corrected the variable name in the second for and added &gt;&gt; output.txt to echo.) One question: At the end of the last line a newline is added (in output.txt, a blank 6th line). Do you have an idea how this could be avoided?<br>
<br>
But, of course, your script doesn't work with binary files (00!). That's why I ask how to do the same using findstr...</div>

I attached a binary compiled with tcc. It reads and writes byte by byte, so it's no speed demon  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" width="15" height="15" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green"></div>

It does not solve my problem with using findstr (and I still hope someone will show me a solution), but:<br>
<br>
Your answer allows me to think of a very different concept for my general project. I did not know that C and TCC make it possible to write such extremely small programs.<br>

I am extremely excited and thank you very much for your answer.<br>

</div></blockquote>
If the lines does not have leading white spaces or equal sign(=) <strong class="text-strong">`set /p "=!var!"&lt;nul&gt;outFile`</strong> can be used for that matter. On Vista and beyond set /p removes leading white spaces from prompt string.<br>
An Alternate less efficient but working method is to use prompt trick:
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>setlocal
.
.
set "prompt=!var:$=$$!"
cmd /d /k &lt;nul&gt;outFile
.
.
endlocal
</code></pre></div>
So using prompt trick as example, that part of code can written as follows
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>for /L %%A in (0,1,%return_count%) do (
		set /p print_line=
		set "prompt=!print_line:$=$$!"
		cmd /d /k &lt;nul
		if %%A LSS %return_count% echo,
	)
</code></pre></div>
set /p is more efficient and cleaner approach but it can not be used with arbitrary data. Either way that is too much of overhead for just eliminating the last newline from output.</div>

That is not necessarily true. As far as I'm concerned, <strong class="text-strong">findstr</strong> on it's own, does not have the capability to filter specific line numbers. So the assumption that any solution of your task involving findstr, can automatically handle binary files is not true.<br>
<br>
However there is a method which can handle binary files based on the criteria you have specified. There is also a method which can only be used to handle text files (Or more precisely files without &lt;NULL&gt; bytes) but in a much more efficient way.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">findstr solution to handle text files:</strong>
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>@echo off
setlocal EnableExtensions DisableDelayedExpansion

:: Parameters
set "Input=input.txt"
set "Output=output.txt"
:: The minimum value for startLine is 1
set /a "startLine=5, endLine=9"


set /a "startLine-=1"
if %startLine% EQU 0 (set "skip=") else set "skip=skip=%startLine%"
(for /F "%skip% tokens=1* delims=:" %%K in ('findstr /N /R "^" "%Input%"') do (
    if %%K LEQ %endLine% (echo(%%L)
))&gt;"%Output%"
</code></pre></div>
The above will work well if the difference between endLine and total number lines in input files is relatively small. for example when endLine=130 and totalLines=134<br>
But as difference gets bigger (endLine=130, totalLines=800) the performance will degrade because batch script have no means of immediate break from FOR loops once the job is done there is no need remain in the loop anymore. The only command that can immediately break FOR loops is <strong class="text-strong">`exit`</strong> but that will also terminates the host cmd instance. The solution is to execute the FOR loop in a child instance of cmd along with exit command.<br>
So the FOR loop block can replaced with this:
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>&gt;"%Output%" cmd /e:on /v:off /d /c for /F "%skip% tokens=1* delims=:" %%K in ^('findstr /N /R "^" "%Input%"'^) do @if %%K LEQ %endLine% ^(echo(%%L^) else exit
</code></pre></div>
This can also be performance killer if the difference between endLine/totalLine is too small and you are processing too many files in this condition. So I think ShadowThief's solution may better suite your needs in this regards. You should test and compare.<br>
<br>
<strong class="text-strong">findstr solution to handle binary files:</strong>
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>@echo off
setlocal EnableExtensions DisableDelayedExpansion

:: Parameters
set "Input=input.bin"
set "Output=output.bin"
set /a "startLine=5, endLine=9"


set /a "cureLine=startLine-1, Lines=endLine-startLine+1, MaxDigits=9"
(for /L %%. in (1,1,%Lines%) do (
    set /a "cureLine+=1, Num=cureLine, LeadChars=1"
    for /L %%. in (1,1,%MaxDigits%) do set /a "LeadChars+=!!Num, Num/=10"
    findstr /N /R "^" "%Input%"|(findstr /R "^%%cureLine%%:")|((for /L %%. in (1,1,%%LeadChars%%) do @pause)&gt;nul &amp; findstr /R "^")

    REM // This line takes into account the possibility for disabled command extensions. Use instead of above if that is a concern.
    REM findstr /N /R "^" "%Input%"|(findstr /R "^%%cureLine%%:")|cmd /e:on /d /c ^(for /L %%^^^. in ^(1,1,%%LeadChars%%^) do @pause^)^&gt;nul ^&amp; findstr /R "^"
))&gt;"%Output%"
</code></pre></div>

This is based on this assumption:
<blockquote><div><cite><a href="memberlistb60b.html?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9243">Bucko</a> wrote: <a href="viewtopic8bbd-2.html?p=57114#p57114" data-post-id="57114" onclick="if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash">↑</a><div class="responsive-hide">09 Jun 2018 12:22</div></cite>
All my binary files (which I intend to use) have "lines" (i.e. newline characters), and these "lines" are not to long for findstr (there is a length limit). So findstr definitely would work with my binary data.
</div></blockquote>

Be aware that this method is extremely slow and inefficient in terms of performance but should do the job. That was the best I could come up with.</div>
