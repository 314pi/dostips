				<div class="content">Hello<br>
Round 2012 I published a batch game called Sokobox that used my tool bg, in this same forum.<br>
But the code stop working ok on windows 10, mainly because outdated internal code of bg, very old version (2.7) when windows 10 still did not exist.<br>
<br>
I read yesterday about this old batch game in this page: <a href="https://www.thebateam.org/2017/05/the-sokoban-game-by-carlos-amazing.html" class="postlink">https://www.thebateam.org/2017/05/the-s ... azing.html</a><br>
<br>
Thus, I'be remastered a little bit the code for works okay on windows 10 with the latest version of bg (3.9)<br>
And changing a little colors.<br>
I publish this new Sokobox version 1.4 only for fun.<br>
<br>

Here inside the bg utility is the updated batch game:<br>

<br>
I hope batch users can continue getting fun with this batch game.</div>

				<div class="content">When did Win10 compatibility start for BG? I'm currently using a lightly custom BG v3.0a (with Color command from tinyBG included), but don't have access to a Win10 machine. Should I use v3.9 to assure compatibility?<br>
<br>
Love the FCprint command! Really speeds up the 1-2 punch of Locate+Print. Just did a speed test and 3.9 is within a millisecond per iteration of 3.0, and not having to call twice should speed things up nicely... looks like I'll be migrating to v3.9 regardless.<br>
<br>
I played HexNuts v1.3 all the way to level 60-something. Ran into a level I simply could not get through, even remember asking you if it was solvable (you assured me it was). Probably time to take another stab at it, and <em class="text-italics">this</em> time everything is 4x larger! Good news for these tired ol' eyes. ^_^<br>
<br>
Thanks for providing this (supposedly) final version of BG, Carlos!</div>

				<div class="content">I was migrating my current project from BG.EXE v3.0a to v3.9 when I noticed this issue.<br>
<br>
The FCPrint command for BG v3.9 seems to use the format:<br>
columns rows color text...<br>
<br>
However, the docs for BG v3.9 state:<br>
rows columns color text...<br>
which is also what all previous versions of BG [Locate rows columns] use, including v3.9.<br>
<br>
Also, unlike ECHO and BG Print, BG FCPrint doesn't 'wrap-around' to the next line when printing text longer than the console's character width... I was unsure if this was intentional.<br>
<br>
Thanks again for the new functionality. FCPrint often took the place of 2 or 3 other BG commands in my script (so it runs much faster overall), and since it was always already being called at least once for 'BG Locate' I don't even mind the exclusion of the 'Color' command (which allowed using the faster 'BG Locate' + SET/P instead of 'BG Locate' + 'BG Print Color').<br>
<br>
Edit: The docs under FCPrint state "The column is fixed."<br>
Now I get it. ^_^<br>
(wait... wouldn't that be 'row is fixed'?)</div>

Bg support to windows 10 begin on version 3.5, that fixed a problem on windows 10 related to font function.<br>
But Bg version 3.9 also fix a problem related to print function, in which was neccesary convert the oem escape sequences to unicode, it was works okay on windows 8, but not on windows 10.<br>
Thus, the full support to windows 10, is in the version 3.9.<br>
<br>
About the unsolvable level: "sokobox" have the same levels that the old "hexnuts", please can you tell me the exact level between 60 and 70 that you would like to know the solution. I solved that levels because I currently playing the level 125.<br>
<br>
About the FCPrint command in the version 3.9, you are right. The documentation is correct but the implementation have that little equivocation.<br>
The column is fixed, meaning that when you include the \n escape sequence the next character will appear in the next row, but not in the column 0 neccesarily, but in the column specified when you call the function.<br>
<br>
Note: I published a second edition of the version 3.9, called "3.9 se".<br>
It implement the FCPrint correclty according to the documentation, and also have a little changes.<br>
The link is the same and the archive have the same name: "bg39.zip" but you can difference from the old because the new contains inside a readme.txt with this text:
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>This package contains the programs of BG 3.9 se (second edition).</div></blockquote>

Yes, also I suppose that version "3.9 se" is the final version.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the interest.</div>

Thanks for supporting BG so that it remains so very useful, hopefully you may deign to again release a fix if any future windows changes render it ineffective. I've been using it for many years and it remains the best all-inclusive command line app for full batch control of the windows console that I know of. You were even able to reduce the size of the executable by another kByte (a full 1024 bytes)... nice.<br>
BG FCPrint has worked amazingly well in my current project! It literally doubled or tripled the speed of a full-color option that I had added, making the animation far more pleasing.
<blockquote class="uncited"><div>...can you tell me the exact level between 60 and 70 that you would like to know</div></blockquote>
I literally haven't played it in years... yet. I'll probably start over on Sokobox at level 1 and work my way back up. Don't worry, I'll surely be asking you for some tips when I get stuck. Level 125? I got some catching up to do. ^_^<br>
I still like the ultra-simplistic look of HexNuts, though. So tiny!</div>
