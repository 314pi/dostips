				<h3>Findstr without pipe</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>18 Jun 2018 01:12</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>Bucko</strong></div>
				<div class="content">I am using a this batch script to extract a part of a binary file following a delimiter string:<br>

<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>@echo off
setlocal enabledelayedexpansion

REM Line number of the delimiter line:
for /F "delims=:" %%a in ('findstr /N "^xxyyzz" "Input.bin"') do set "lines=%%a"
echo %lines%

REM Extract the part of the Input.bin following the delimiter line:
&lt; "Input.bin" (

   REM Pass thru the first lines:
   for /L %%i in (1,1,%lines%) do set /P "="

   REM Copy the rest to output bin:
   findstr "^"

) &gt; Output.bin</code></pre></div>

This is working fine, but with some files I get the error messages "Line ... too long". I know that this problem is associated to piping. I also found the tip:<br>
<br>
"The line too long error only happens when FINDSTR reads the input via redirection or a pipe. <strong class="text-strong"><span style="text-decoration: underline">That error goes away if you pass the name (path) of the file directly to FINDSTR.</span></strong>"<br>
<br>
My understanding of batch-command syntax is too poor to find out how this could be done in my above script. Can someone here help?<br>
<br>
Cheers.</div>

<br>
You may solve your problem via a third party .exe program, as explained at <a href="viewtopicf458.html?f=3&amp;t=8605&amp;p=57135#p57135" class="postlink">this answer</a>. You may even embeed the <strong class="text-strong">ReadFile.exe</strong> auxiliary program into <em class="text-italics">the same</em> Batch file that contain the rest of binary files, and extract it via findstr before extract the rest of files...<br>

Thank you, Aacini, I appreciate your help very much. Yes, this is my third question related to findstr, but it is not the same question. This one is the most reduced one, <strong class="text-strong">associated to a concept which is working fine with findstr</strong> (extracting from a certain point up to the end of the file).<br>
<br>
My hope was that this script <strong class="text-strong">could be adapted (by avoiding piping) to overcome the last (?) problem</strong> I have. May I understand your answer in such manner that the script basically <strong class="text-strong">can not be rewritten in this sense</strong>?<br>
<br>
(Yes, I understand your suggestions refering to third-party tools. In this special case I shouldn't use them. An alternative would be a simple <em class="text-italics">'own'</em> auxilliary exe, a code which could be compiled by myself, but until now I failed to find something like this... Such a 'launcher tool' would have to extract at least a part of a binary and run a specified file; and unicode file names should be supported, which makes the coding difficult...)<br>
<br>
Cheers, Bucko</div>

</div></blockquote>Although i'm not Antonio, i also think it is the third time you are asking the question:<br>
"How to xtract data from a certain point up to the end of the file using findstr only?"<br>
<br>

<blockquote><div><cite><a href="memberlistb60b.html?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=9243">Bucko</a> wrote: <a href="viewtopic345a.html?p=57183#p57183" data-post-id="57183" onclick="if(document.getElementById(hash.substr(1)))href=hash">↑</a><div class="responsive-hide">18 Jun 2018 09:45</div></cite>This one is the most reduced one, <strong class="text-strong">associated to a concept which is working fine with findstr</strong> (extracting from a certain point up to the end of the file).</div></blockquote>First, your concept for example fails if a line you want to skip has more than 1024 characters in it.<br>
Second, you miss the fact (which i admit is hard to see) that findstr doesn't extract data from a certain point in your example:<br>
It is the stream (created when redirecting the file "Input.bin"), that extracts data from a certain point (not findstr).<br>
