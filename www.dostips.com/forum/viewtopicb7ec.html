				<div class="content">I am attempting to get the size of a specific folder without having to run the cmd with being elevated. Is this possible. I just one one number which is the folder size exported to a text file. I have tried a bunch of different ways but it either <br>
<br>
1) gives me too much information<br>
2) requires elevation<br>
<br>
for a little background I am attempting to find out how many of the computers on our network are effected by the windows 7 cab file bug. We have had a few computers C drives become completely full from this issue. I am hoping I do not have a time bomb bug in our systems. So i want a script I can deploy that will write a file with a number of that folder size. Then I have a macro that will pull in every file and form two rows.<br>
<br>
1) name of that file(PCID) <br>
2) the size inside <br>
