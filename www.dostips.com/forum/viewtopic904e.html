				<div class="content">Hello all,<br />Im a first time poster in need of help.<br />I have been searching this site and other but am unable to find anything that will trigger what I need to know.<br /><br />Heres what I am trying to do.<br /><br />I want to start a batch file that prompts me to enter a command then run the associated application. The command needs to be a variable so when I am prompted I can type any executable I want such as winword.exe or powerpnt.exe.  Then I need that variable to plug into the executable path.<br /><br />Example:<br /><br />set /p %1=Enter command:<br />if &quot;%1&quot;==&quot;%1&quot; call :run<br /><br />:run<br />&quot;c:\program files\microsoft office\office14\%1&quot;<br /><br />So after command I want to be able to type winword.exe and have it replace %1 in the executable path and start Word.<br /><br />I have tried many variations but with no sucess.<br /><br />Thank you for any help you can give.</div>

				<div class="content">You basically have it<br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>set /p theprogram=Enter command:<br />REM check that it is an executable.<br />echo %theprogram%:~-4%<br />if &quot;%theprogram:~-4%&quot;==&quot;.exe&quot; (<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Echo.Running Program %theprogram%...<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;%theprogram%<br />) else (<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Echo.Not a valid executable.<br />)<br /></code></pre></div><br />The real problem is that you need to know the full path to the executable unless you put it in the PATH statement.  So, in this example, notepad.exe and write.exe will work but, winword.exe and excel.exe will not.</div>

				<div class="content">Because <strong class="text-strong"><em class="text-italics">c:\program files\microsoft office\office14</em></strong> is not part of the PATH variable you would need the full name. The START command could work without path and it's probably a better way (because it makes no sense to keep the batch window open).<br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>&nbsp; start &quot;&quot; /max &quot;%theprogram%&quot;<br /></code></pre></div><br /><br />And (@ChickenSoup) what happens if the user hits the Enter button without inputting something? And what happens if the extension is .EXE instead of .exe?  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> <br /><br />Regards<br />aGerman</div>

				<div class="content">Good points.  I always miss some of the obvious.  If they enter nothing, it will return &quot;Not a valid executable.&quot;<br />So how does this look?<br /><br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>set /p theprogram=Enter command:<br />REM check that it is an executable.<br />if /i &quot;%theprogram:~-4%&quot;==&quot;.exe&quot; (<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Echo.Running Program %theprogram%...<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;start &quot;&quot; /max &quot;%theprogram%&quot;<br />) else (<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Echo.Not a valid executable.<br />)</code></pre></div><br /><br />By the way, I just found this forum the other day and love it!  I have had a love for batch scripting for years and have already learned a ton more from this site!  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>

				<div class="content">Yeah, looks much better.<br />My proposal:<br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>@echo off<br />:loop<br />set &quot;theprogram=&quot;<br />set /p &quot;theprogram=Enter command: &quot;<br />if not defined theprogram goto loop<br />start &quot;&quot; /max &quot;%theprogram%&quot; ||goto loop<br /><br /></code></pre></div><br />IMO no need to check if the file is an executable because START will do it for you. BTW try to enter e.g. <em class="text-italics">excel </em>(without .exe). Works for me <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> <br /><br />Regards<br />aGerman</div>

				<div class="content">That worked out nice even though I dont understand how it works just yet.<br />Thank you ChickenSoup.<br /><br />I should explain though and maybe ask if there is someway to make the batch file more versitile?  What I mean is that I was hoping with this batch file to use it in other situations with some slight modifications.<br /><br />An example of a different command were I am still prompted for input but the input is different and the variable in a different place in the command string.<br /><br />Example:<br /><br />set /p %1%2%3=Enter Operation:<br /><br />ECHO &quot;CN=%1,OU=%2 %3,DC=ACMEDOM1,DC=COM&quot; -pwd * -samid %1 -upn %1@ACMEDOM1.COM<br /><br />If I execute this batch file without the &quot;set&quot; function It will copy the input I want into the percent variables.  Lets say the batch file is named &quot;test.bat&quot;<br />If I type test Username Domain Users  the output will echo replacing all %1's with Username, %2 with Domain and %3 with Users.<br /><br />I don't know how to plug the &quot;set&quot; function into the command string.<br />This is my main goal and I cant find my way. I get many errors such as goto cannot run or no executable found.<br /><br />Thank you for any assistance you can lend, and thank you again for the first batch file resolve.</div>

				<div class="content">I am confused to what you are getting at.<br /><br />If you have a batch file named test.bat with the following code:<br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>echo.Variable1 %1<br />echo.Variable2 %2<br />echo.Variable3 %3<br /></code></pre></div><br />and you type &quot;test.bat one two three&quot;, your output will be<br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>Variable1 one<br />Variable2 two<br />Variable3 three<br /></code></pre></div><br />That is where you use %1, %2, etc.<br /><br />Or are you looking at something conditional? That is, if you enter &quot;winword.exe&quot; for the &quot;operation&quot;, it then asks a specific set of questions on that?</div>

				<div class="content">Originally I was and am still working on two seemingly different batch files.<br />However the way I was trying to make them work seemed similar so I just posted about the one for my office apps, which you made work great but in doing so it made me see that my other batch file could not be made the same way.  My other bacth file is only similar I guess in that I want it to ask for information that will will then plug into the command string.<br /><br />my second batch file is using the dsadd user command.<br /><br />dsadd user &quot;cn=%1,cn=%2,dc=acmedom1,dc=com&quot; -pwd * -samid %1 -upn %1@ACMEDOM1.COM<br /><br />If I just type in a prompt &quot;test.bat Username Users&quot; , then Username replaces %1 and Users replaces %2.<br /><br />I would like to be prompted to enter a username then enter a group, username being %1 and group being %2, and then have those names plug into the above command string.  <br /><br />To my eyes my initial office batch file seemed similar but now I dont know.<br />Also, I dont know how to deal with the %2 if I have a group name that is made up of two words such as group name.<br /><br />I hope that makes more sense, Im sorry for the confusion.<br />Thank you,</div>

				<div class="content">This makes much more sense.<br />Well, if you want it to prompt for Enter user name and Enter group name, it will look something like this:<br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>set /p strusername=Enter the user name: <br />set /p strgroup=Enter the group name: <br />dsadd user &quot;cn=%strusername%,cn=%strgroup%,dc=acmedom1,dc=com&quot; -pwd * -samid %strusername% -upn %strusername%@ACMEDOM1.COM<br /></code></pre></div><br /><br />if you want it to run like test.bat %1 %2, you would have something like this:<br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>for /f &quot;useback tokens=*&quot; %%a in ('%1') do set strusername=%%~a<br />for /f &quot;useback tokens=*&quot; %%a in ('%2) do set strgroup=%%~a<br />dsadd user &quot;cn=%strusername%,cn=%strgroup%,dc=acmedom1,dc=com&quot; -pwd * -samid %strusername% -upn %strusername%@ACMEDOM1.COM<br /></code></pre></div><br />If your group has a space in it you would run the command like this:<br />test.bat user &quot;my group&quot;<br />the 2 FOR loops will strip the quotes from the strings.</div>
