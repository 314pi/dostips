I would like to monitor a directory of logs for specific occurrences of memory issues.    Manually I run findstr -s *Heap.memory" from the command prompt.  I'm looking for some help/expertise to have a batch file I could run as a windows scheduled task daily, initiate a search of the logs and if a string is found to be able to notify.<br>

Just add that command to a batch file. You want to be informed when the string is found so you can use the onSucces command which is just a double &amp; symbol. onSucces you will want to be informed so you may want a messageBox to popup informing you about that.
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>@echo off

findstr.EXE /S /I /R "*heap.memory" &amp;&amp;(

	net.EXE START messenger
	net.EXE SEND "%COMPUTERNAME%" "heap.memory found"
	pause
 )
 
 exit 0
</code></pre></div>
Now the shedule, you may want the batch to be interactive so you can scroll and get more detailed info.<br>
Because this information is missing i will assume you will only want to be informed when you are logged in as Administrator.
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>schtasks.EXE /CREATE /U Administrator /P myPassword /SC DAILY /TN heapMemory /TR "%~f0" /ST 00:00:00
</code></pre></div>
But you can also add the job using the GUI named Planned Tasks.<br>
<br>
You may want the batch to produce a logfile of it's own and then open it instead of simple informing a match was found. I will leave that up to you.. Oh i forgot the email part, I will help you with that later if i get a response from you.</div>

I added some comments and included an exemplary mail.<br>
<br>
before using this script make a telnet connection with your mail server to figure out what it uses for default encoding.<br>
Most mail servers use base64 for login, you can figure that out by looking at the server's response.<br>
<br>
if you address the server with HELO it should default to plain text or base64. and reply with Hello<br>
if you greet it with EHLO, it should enable an encrypted connection.<br>
you can just say helo and then later enable encoding also but is server specific.<br>
<br>
i ask you to google for ICMP yourself and first learn to talk with the server using telnet.<br>
once you figure out how to send mails manually, this batch can be a nice template to script future messages.<br>
<br>

I've attached a zip file containing a base64 enc-/decoder and the telnet scripting tool required for automating telnet.<br>

Oh last thing but important if you intend to use my template, you need to change the date function because i coded it for dutch machine. Normally I include macro's that retrieve this info from registry but I seemed not have done that here, it would also complicate things for you if the function would malfunction so i just leave it like this.<br>
<br>
You may not understand every command of this script so I explain the most important things briefly, most people on this forum also know. $LF is a linefeed, ( do not remove the empty line it is intentionally ), $c1 is a line continuation that is only for visual convenience it will not be inside any macro. $n1c is a linefeed and a continuation identical to \n that you may have seen other people use, but i use my own definitions because i use various types of those depending on nesting and expansion states. $ is not necessary but it is my variable identifier required by doskit ( my function library ).</div>
