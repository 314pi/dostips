				<div class="content">Hi,<br>
<br>
I'm trying to build a batch file using just one line for FTP access. For this i'm using "cmd /c" as a starter and then the commands are in front of it. I have tried diferent ways but i can't seem to find a way to make it work. If i try one long string i can't execute it. If i use the "&gt;" to save to a file the code needs to be formated with a break line separating each command i have tried \n, &amp;, &amp;&amp;, echo. between others and nothing. Any tips?<br>
<br>
I read here in the forum about EOL code but i couldn't figure it out!<br>
<br>
Thanks</div>

Also, chaining FTP commands has nothing to do with batch and everything to do with FTP itself. That said, if &amp; didn't work for you, nothing will, since the "correct" way to do an FTP one-liner is to make a temporary file with each command on a separate line.</div>

I'm trying to create a file and then execute it
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>cmd /c echo ftp.exe&gt;text.bat &amp; echo open 127.0.0.1&gt;&gt;text.bat &amp; echo username&gt;&gt;text.bat &amp; echo password&gt;&gt;text.bat text.bat
</code></pre></div></div>

I have retried the &amp; and it did work but it didn't execute (see the post above)</div>

				<div class="content">I think you would need &amp; Text.bat at the end to execute the bat file. But why? Just echo the ftp commands to a script file and the execute ftp.exe with the script file.<br>
<br>
I think you could also chain the ftp commands inside parentheses and pipe to ftp.<br>
<br>
(Echo open server &amp; echo username &amp; echo password  &amp; echo put file.txt)|ftp.exe</div>

				<div class="content">Don't mix up Batch and FTP. You can pass an FTP script to ftp.exe but you cannot have Batch code in an FTP script and then assume that it will automatically work. Those are two languages even if the commands are pretty similar.<br>
There <em class="text-italics">are</em> possibilities to have both in one script:<br>
<a href="../DtTipsFtpBatchScript.html" class="postlink">https://www.dostips.com/DtTipsFtpBatchScript.php</a><br>
But I'd prefer to write the FTP script to an extra file.<br>
