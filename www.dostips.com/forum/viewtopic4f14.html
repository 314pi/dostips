				<h3>Batch Text Game?</h3>

				<div class="content">Hello, I'm just starting out in the world of programming and batch scripting and the like. I know, it's 2018, where have I been??<br>
<br>
So, I'm attempting to write a basic puzzle game, just to get it all down pat before I expand and try to make a "full size" game. There are a few concepts that I thought would be doable with my current knowledge, but alas, are not. The first is writing multiple words for an answer, example<br>
<br>
set /p answer= You see a glowstick, what do you do?<br>
if %answer%==Pick Up Glowstick goto ObservationDeck_NoStick<br>
<br>
however typing in Pick Up Glowstick, causes the game to crash. Any clues as to what I am doing wrong?<br>
<br>
The other main issue I am having is creating an Inventory to store the items and hopefully remove them from the scene. It's a two fold question I guess. How do I set up the inventory and is there a way to remove the item from the "scene" or do I stick to the current method of making a new scene that simply doesn't include it. Example<br>
<br>
echo The observation desk is empty.<br>
echo You see a glowstick on a bench<br>
set /p answer= What would you like to do?<br>
if %answer%==Pick up glowstick *inventory part here(?)*<br>
goto ObservationDesk_NoGlowstick<br>
<br>
<br>
If this has already been covered somewhere, my search skills are lacking and I apologize. Also, thank you in advance!</div>

				<div class="content">The comparison has to know where to stop so it knows what command to run.  Spaces are a delimiter of a command so it thinks the next word after the space is the command it has to run.<br>
<br>
Let's take this for example.  Let say you want to check if there answer was equal to GOTO GOTO.
<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code> if %answer%==goto goto goto label</code></pre></div>
How would it know which goto is the actual GOTO command and not the string it is comparing.<br>
<br>
So when comparing strings you always quote as a best practice.<br>

<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>if "%answer%"=="goto goto" goto label</code></pre></div></div>
