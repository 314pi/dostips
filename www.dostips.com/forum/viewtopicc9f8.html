				<div class="content">Forgive me for interrupting the festivities, but this site is amazing and I just have to say it. Its latest gift to me is one of the finest I've found yet:<br>
<br>
DOS - String Manipulation<br>
<a href="../DtTipsStringManipulation.html" class="postlink">https://www.dostips.com/DtTipsStringManipulation.php</a><br>
<br>
Like many other pages here it is truly a work of art. I wish whoever wrote that "tip and trick" would be acknowledged.<br>
<br>
BTW I'm hoping not to cause too great a distraction and I don't want to tempt everyone to reply indicating their most delicious page at the site, unless admins agree or want to start something like that for fun and for recognition. I don't see a "talk forum", just this one, so I don't want to presume that distracting chit-chat belongs on this board. Nonetheless I wanted to especially thank someone for the groovy page above.</div>
