				<div class="content">I did a little code profiling on the weekend. Outcome is that threading of the conversion isn't as important as I expected. It makes more sense to separate reading and writing on the file system because these are slow processes. I changed the behavior in a way that writing is done in a parallel thread while the next chunk of data can be read. Surprisingly I got the best performance results if both converting and writing run together in one thread.<br />To cut it short: The performance increasement is insignificant but existing. Thus, I'd like to share it by version 1.4.1.<br /><br />Steffen</div>

				<div class="content">I managed to add carlos' size improvements. See comments of the DECREASE_SIZE_GCC macro in the source code. That way the size of the utility was reduced by half (without noticeable performance increasement though).<br />In order to preserve cross-compiler support I added a few pre-processor directives for retrieving arguments UTF-16-encoded.<br /><br />Since I don't have any experiences with this kind of size optimizations yet I would like you to report if the new version causes false positives of your antivirus software.<br /><br />Steffen</div>

				<div class="content">I was asked to add another option in order to automatically replace the original file content with the converted content. I won't do so.<br /><br />The utility was designed to convert big files. That means it doesn't read the whole content into memory before it begins with the conversion in order to avoid running out of RAM space and to be able to read and convert data in parallel threads. Concurrent access to the same file could cause data losses, especially if the converted data is bigger than the data read.<br />Of course I could let the tool automatically write to a temporary file and replace the original file after the conversion was finished. But as soon as the temporary file and the original file are saved on different volumes this would cause a physical copying of data which wastes time and resources.<br /><br />Thus, I would rather keep it in your hands. Moving a file to another file at the same logical drive will only lead to changing the file addressing. Example:<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>convertcp 1 65001 /b /i &quot;test.txt&quot; /o &quot;test.txt.temp~&quot;<br />if not errorlevel 1 move /y &quot;test.txt.temp~&quot; &quot;test.txt&quot;<br /></code></pre></div><br /><br />Steffen</div>

				<div class="content">Great tool Steffen.<br /><br />I have another option for you - the new <a href="viewtopicb16d.html?f=3&amp;t=6044" class="postlink">JREPL.BAT</a> version 7 features (currently v7.4), can also be used to transform a text file from one encoding to another. I believe it is more restrictive on which character sets can be used because it only supports your machines native code page, plus UTF-16LE, plus code pages that have valid internet character set names. <strong class="text-strong"><em class="text-italics">EDIT - Actually it is not that bad. <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd317756(v=vs.85).aspx" class="postlink">Here is a page</a> that lists code pages along with there internet (.NET) names. Most of the code pages have a valid name</em></strong><br /><br />Here is an example that transforms 1252 to UTF-8:<br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>jrepl &quot;^&quot; &quot;&quot; /f &quot;source.txt|Windows-1252&quot; /o &quot;destination.txt|UTF-8&quot;<br /></code></pre></div><br />But JREPL has a significant advantage in that you can provide custom transformations for source characters that do not exist in the target character set. This could satisfy Sasso's &quot;custom character set&quot; request. This is probably easiest to accomplish by using the JREPL /T option.<br /><br />One thing that is pretty cool is that with the /X option, you can specify a character using the \xnn escape sequence, where nn is the hexadecimal byte code for the relevant character set. Within a search string it uses the input character set. Within a replacement string it uses the output character set. The \xnn sequence only works properly if the character set is a single byte character set.<br /><br />With the /T &quot;FILE&quot; option, you can place all your search terms in one file, one per line, and all your replacement (transform) terms in a 2nd file. This helps prevent out of control command line lengths. Another cool feature is you can specify that the search file matches the input character set, and the replacement file matches the output character set.<br /><br />There is no need for the transformations to involve just single characters. One input character can be transformed into multiple output characters, and vice versa.<br /><br />Here is an example of what a custom transformation could look like (without specifying the actual custom transformations)<br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>jrepl &quot;1252to1250find.txt|Windows-1252&quot; &quot;1252to1250repl.txt|Windows-1250&quot; /x /t file /f &quot;source.txt|Windows-1252&quot; /o &quot;destination.txt|Windows-1250&quot;<br /></code></pre></div><br /><br />Dave Benham</div>

				<div class="content">Dave<br /><br />I'm quite interested in JREPL.BAT as you know. Using ADO streams was a huge improvement. Also for my understanding it's a good alternative for CONVERTCP.<br /><br />Of course everything has pros and cons. What I really like is that JREPL doesn't need any 3rd party tools. It's something that I can't compete with CONVERTCP. To compensate this deficiency a little I used C and WinAPI (that runs natively and isn't dependent on .NET or Java), I provided the source code (to enable people to read or edit the source and compile the tool by themself) and added a program flow chart (because an executable is like a black box where you can't see the way it works). <br />On the other hand the main scopes of JREPL and CONVERTCP are quite different. This makes that JREPL is able (and designed) to do customized replacements while CONVERTCP can't do that. But this also makes that CONVERTCP is so much faster for big files. 307s JREPL vs. 9s CONVERTCP for 360MB of text Windows-1252 to UTF-8 in my tests because it efficiently converts and writes in parallel threads. Converting big files was one of Saso's original requirements.<br /><br />I don't want to make a fuss about CONVERTCP. Initially it was a gift to Saso who suggested to publish it. So why not <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> It seems to be helpful for some people. Version 1.4.4 was downloaded ~120 times now. That's approx. once a day and thus, maybe 10 times more than I would have ever expected but isn't comparable to what JREPL catches on <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> At the end there is no &quot;nec plus ultra&quot;. The users have to decide which meets their needs best. For that reason I really appreciate that you left some notes and a link to JREPL.BAT in this thread. This will give the users more opportunities to find the right tool for their tasks <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br /><br />Steffen<br /><br /><strong class="text-strong"><em class="text-italics">This tangential topic about JREPL continues at <a href="viewtopic8650.html?f=3&amp;t=8152" class="postlink">JREPL.BAT, ADO Streams and big files</a></em></strong></div>
